👋🏽 Hello, my name is Boa Kim.

🌇 I am currently living in Bethesda, Maryland.

I am eager to continue my education at the graduate level to further develop my analytical skills and pursue a career as a data scientist. 

My research interests revolve around developing assessments and evaluations for mental health using machine learning, natural language processing, and text analysis. 

I am driven by the desire to contribute to improving the lives of individuals with mental disabilities by providing more accurate and effective assessments from a young age.

🏕In my free time, I enjoy camping with my family. My favorite part of camping is grilling marshmallows with my daughter, Julia. ️
