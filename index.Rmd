👋🏽 Hello, my name is Boa Kim. I am from South Korea. 

🏡 I am living in Bethesda, Maryland.

💻 Currently, I am working in dentistry as a data administrator/administrative assistant to help my family's business.

📓 I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at a local college and taught myself. 

🎓 I have an MS in Business Administration from Seoul National University, South Korea, where I completed my master's thesis, which focused on consumer behavioral analysis based on statistical methods. 

🧑‍🏫 I am eager to continue my education at the graduate level to further develop my analytical skills and pursue a career as a data scientist. 

💡 My research interests revolve around developing assessments and evaluations for mental health using machine learning, natural language processing, and text analysis. 

❤️ I am driven by the desire to contribute to improving the lives of individuals with mental disabilities by providing more accurate and effective assessments from a young age.

⛺ In my free time, I enjoy camping. My favorite part of camping is grilling marshmallows with my daughter, Julia.
