### 1. Abstract

This study examines cause-related product consumption as a costly signal that can imply positive status to others. While existing research typically investigates status consumption for luxury products, this study proposes that cause-related products have become a status symbol. Two studies demonstrate that people confer higher status to 
cause-related product consumption rather than general product consumption. These positive inferences are driven by perceived altruism and moderated by individual differences in moral identity symbolization in the observers.

### 3. Hypotheses
-H1: Cause-related product consumption is expected to lead to higher status inferences 
compared to general product consumption.
-H2: The effect specified in H1 is mediated by perceived altruism.

-H3: In the effect of cause related products consumption on status inference through the 
perceived altruism, people with high moral identity symbolism will have a stronger effect 
than those with low moral identity symbolism.

### 4. Methodology & Summary

  + LASSO regressions showed the best performance with a cross validation RMSE-score of 0.1121. Although there is a lot of multicollinearity among the variables, LASSO regression include feature selection; it does not select a substantial number of the available variables in its model, as it is supposed to do.
  + The XGBoost model also performs very well with a cross validation RMSE of 0.1162.
  + As those two algorithms are very different, averaging predictions is likely to improve the predictions. As the Lasso cross validated RMSE is better than XGBoost's CV score, I decided to weight the Lasso results double.
