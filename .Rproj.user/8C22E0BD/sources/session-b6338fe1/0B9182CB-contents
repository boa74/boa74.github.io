### 1. Abstract
<br>

This study examines cause-related product consumption as a costly signal that can imply positive status to others. While existing research typically investigates status consumption for luxury products, this study proposes that cause-related products have become a status symbol. Two studies demonstrate that people confer higher status to 
cause-related product consumption rather than general product consumption. These positive inferences are driven by perceived altruism and moderated by individual differences in moral identity symbolization in the observers.

### 3. Hypotheses
<br>

-H1: Cause-related product consumption is expected to lead to higher status inferences 
compared to general product consumption.

-H2: The effect specified in H1 is mediated by perceived altruism.

-H3: In the effect of cause related products consumption on status inference through the 
perceived altruism, people with high moral identity symbolism will have a stronger effect 
than those with low moral identity symbolism.

### 4. Methodology & Results

  + Main Effect(H1).
  There was a significant difference in status inference based on cause-related product consumption, with status inference being significantly higher for cause-related product consumption compared to general product consumption (M no condition=4.779, SD=.779 vs. M condition=5.053, SD= .715, t(146)=-2.217, p=0.028). Thus, the impact of cause-related product consumption on status inference was confirmed to be significant


  + Mediation Effect(H2)
The mediation analysis showed that perceived altruism mediated the effect of cause Source Cause related Products Consumption Hayes(2013, model 4), I tested the significance of the mediator by 5000 bootstrapped 
samples.
